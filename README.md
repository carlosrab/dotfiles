# Nixpkgs

Files in this directory are our nixpkgs configuration that serves to easily replicate my development setup in different devices and environments.

## Home Manager

Together with home manager nixpkgs helps manage dotfiles as well. So ideally I do not need to maintain a separate repository for dotfile configurations.

## Experimental

I am currently testing this setup and hopefully it will result in an easy to use pattern for current and future setups.
